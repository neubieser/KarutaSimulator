The Mother of Gido Sanshi
If remembering me|Will for him in future years|Be too difficult,
It would be well this very day|That I should end my life.
Gido Sanshi no Haha
Wasureji no|Yukusue made wa|Katakereba
Kyo o kagiri no|Inochi to mo gana
儀同三司母
忘れじの|行末までは|難ければ
今日を限りの|命ともがな
wa su re
忘れじ
けふをかぎりのいのちともがな

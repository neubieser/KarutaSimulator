Hey check out this fun Karuta stuff I have.
Run ./play to try out a "real game"

How to play:
* Hit the Play button to have the reader read a poem.
* If the poem is on the board, click it to make it disappear.
* If you need help, the Reveal button will tell you whose side it is on.
* Rerack will push the cards to the edges.
* Have fun!

Use python 2.7


This is very much WIP

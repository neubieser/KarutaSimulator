Requirements:
* Pillow (installable via pip)


Hey check out this fun Karuta stuff I have.
Run ./play to try out a "real game"

How to play:
* Hit the Play button to have the reader read a poem.
* If the poem is on the board, click it to make it disappear.
* If you need help, the Reveal button will tell you whose side it is on.
* Rerack will push the cards to the edges.
* Have fun!

Use python 2.7

For multiplayer:
* Edit the file server.config to where you will host your server
* ./runServer to start it running
* ./playMulti IP_ADDRESS PORT to play someone else on that server
* For now, you have to restart the server every time you play a new game, or someone disconnects

This is very much WIP
